# Security policy

Thank you for wanting to help keep FinSight secure.

Reporting a Vulnerability

- If you find a security issue, please do not open a public issue. Contact the maintainers privately via an email listed in the repository (or open a private support ticket if your org provides one).
- Describe the issue, affected versions, and steps to reproduce. Attach proof-of-concept if possible.

Response policy

- We will acknowledge reports within 72 hours and provide updates on remediation and timelines.

Disclosure

- We will coordinate disclosure timelines and will generally aim to release fixes before public disclosure.

Third-party dependencies

- Keep dependencies up-to-date; if you discover a vulnerable dependency, report it here and we will triage in CI.
