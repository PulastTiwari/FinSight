## Project Discussions

This repository uses GitHub Discussions for open conversation, design decisions, and community collaboration. Use discussions for questions, proposals, and general chat that don't belong in issues or pull requests.

Suggested categories
- Q&A — usage questions and how-to help
- Ideas — feature proposals and roadmap discussions
- Show and Tell — demos, experiments, and community showcases
- Support — help with errors, environment setup, or running the demo
- Governance — contributing, code of conduct, and community rules

How to post
1. Pick the category that best fits your post.
2. Give a clear, short title and a short description (1–3 paragraphs).
3. Add steps to reproduce for bugs, a short design sketch for ideas, or a runnable snippet for demos.

Moderation and behaviour
- Be respectful; follow the repository's code of conduct (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- Keep discussion on-topic for the selected category.
- Maintainers will label and move items into issues/PRs when necessary.

Linking to issues / PRs
- When a discussion leads to a concrete task, link or create an issue and cross-reference the discussion.

If you prefer not to use GitHub Discussions, open an issue prefixed with `[meta]` or contact a maintainer directly.

Small note: if you want, I can enable a few starter pinned discussions (like "Community Welcome" and "Roadmap") after you confirm titles.
